# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to assist SellBy in another project that compares their reviews against their competitors. This project analyzes Amazon Vine program reviews by members that are paid to publish reviews. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

- There were a small number of 94 Vine reviews, and 40,565 non-Vine reviews for video game products. 

- There were 48 5-star Vine reviews, and 15,663 5-star non-Vine reviews.

- 51% of Vine reviews were 5-star, and 39% of non-Vine reviews wer 5-star. 

## Summary: 

Based off the results, there seems to be a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. About 12% more reviews were 5-star in the Vine program compared to the non-Vine reviews. An additional analysis I would perform to support this claim would be replicating the same methodology with other Amazon datasets. This would enable a better understanding if a similar pattern is occurring across other datasets, giving us a more statistically significant survey sample.
